    <h3>  blackberrying </h3>
      <h5>by sylvia plath</h5>
      <div class= container>
        <img src="image1.jpeg" alt="blackberry">
<div class= p1> <p> Nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries, <br>
Blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly,<br>
A blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea<br>
Somewhere at the end of it, heaving. Blackberries<br>
Big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes<br>
Ebon in the hedges, fat<br>
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my fingers.<br>
I had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me.<br>
They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.<br>
</p> </div>
<div class= p2> <p>
Overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks—<br>
Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky.<br>
Theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting.<br>
I do not think the sea will appear at all.<br>
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within.<br>
I come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies,<br>
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a Chinese screen.<br>
The honey-feast of the berries has stunned them; they believe in heaven.   <br>
One more hook, and the berries and bushes end.</p> </div>
<div class= p3> <p>
The only thing to come now is the sea.
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,
Slapping its phantom laundry in my face.
These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt.
I follow the sheep path between them. A last hook brings me
To the hills’ northern face, and the face is orange rock
That looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space
Of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths
Beating and beating at an intractable metal.
